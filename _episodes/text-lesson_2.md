# Welcome
In this part of the workshop we will check out your experiences, and what your current process looks like with respect to data sharing


> ## Group discussion
> In small groups, discuss potential barriers to sharing data
> 
> We'll come back to this in the full group and work through some worries and misconceptions, and how we can navigate these.

> ## With a specific project in mind,  What's included in your process? what do you already have sorted? (note, to be ordered)
We will use this to guide the next sections of the workshop towards your specific projects. It will also be useful to reflect on when in your process you usually think about these things. 
> - repository
> - sharing summary data
> - sharing processed data
> - sharing raw data
> - licensing the data
> - building a data dictionary or codebook
> - sharing other materials, e.g. code, alongside the data
> - privacy, anonymity, and GDPR

# Looking forward
