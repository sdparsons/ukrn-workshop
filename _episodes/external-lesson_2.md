exercises: 35
duration: null
summary: Presenting the key points from the DCC's data sharing checklist.
questions:
  - Why are we sharing the data?
  - Which data should we share?
  - How much time/money will it cost?
objectives:
  - Understand how the key data sharing questions relate to your work
keypoints:
  - There are several common reasons for sharing data, including verification of
    results and further analysis.
  - Generally, if you can share data, do.
  - Sharing data has time and money costs - who is paying them?

## Digital Curation Centre

The DCC has a wealth of expert guidance on data sharing and curation. 
They are responsible for the widely-used [DMPonline data management plan form](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/).

In this lesson, we will discuss a condensed form of the [DCC guide on deciding what data to keep](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides/five-steps-decide-what-data-keep). 

> ## What could the data be used for?
> * **Reproducibility**: ensuring your data are consistent with the reported results.
> * **Reanalysis/Meta-analysis**: answering different questions to the ones already asked; answering the same question analysed in a different way; contributing to a wider understanding through integration with other similar data.
> * **Common example**: acting as a reference point to facilitate discussion and shared understandings; contributing to a body of observed facts that theories must account for.
> * **Teaching**: allowing learners to perform analysis on real data.
> * **Personal backup**: preserving access across computers and institutions.
{: .checklist}

> ## Discussion `10 min`
> Which of the reasons above are relevant to your research?
> 
> Are there other reasons you might share data?
{: .discussion}

> ## What policies apply?
> * **Journal policies**
> * **Institutional policies**
> * **Funder policies**
> * **Government policies**, which may include security classification and freedom of information policies.
> * **Contract/patent rules**
> * **Use for legal/public/police enquiries**
> * **Personal data rules (GDPR)**
> * **Ethics and consent**
{: .checklist}

> ## Discussion `10 min`
> Which of the policies and considerations above are relevant to your research?
> 
> Does your institution have a data sharing policy? 
> 
> Can you share anonymised data gathered from people without express consent?
> 
> Do other policies apply to your research not mentioned here?
{: .discussion}

> ## What data should be shared?
> * **Relevance**: are the data relevant to reported results?
> * **Quality**: is the data sufficiently complete, coherent, valid, etc. to be useful?
> * **Metadata**: can we provide enough information about what the data are, how they were collected, etc?
> * **Demand/appeal**: will the data be of use to specific people? Will the data contribute to existing resources that are of use? Do the data support published research?
> * **Uniqueness**: can the data be easily reproduced (e.g. random numbers from a seeded generator)
{: .checklist}

> ## Discussion `10 min`
> How do these considerations relate to your research data?
> 
> Are there other considerations that apply to your data?
{: .discussion}

> ## Costs of sharing
> * **Curation**: getting the data in an open format; adding metadata and creating a data dictionary.
> * **Storage**: housing in a repository and keeping available.
{: .checklist}

> ## Discussion `5 min`
> Who will pay these costs?
>
> Are they time/money costs? 
> 
> Will they pay off in the long run? 
> 
> Might they benefit you even if you didn't share? 
>
> Are there other costs that apply to sharing your data?
