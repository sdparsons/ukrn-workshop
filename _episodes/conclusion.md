## Thank you

Sharing data helps us all to build more collaborative and more effective research programmes.
By embedding data sharing in the heart of the project, you not only ensure that you embrace the practice, but that you do so in a way that puts other researchers on an equal footing with yourself.

This approach will help you in your own work, as well as helping others.
You can easily access your data from another computer without needing to remember your cloud sign-in details.
You can share the data with your supervisor/collaborators easily.
When you come to need the data in a few months or years, you won't have to worry about tracking it down or whether it was deleted, because you know where it is, and you can cite it with a DOI.

Stay in touch, and let us know how you get on with born open data: if you need a refresher on how to implement born-open data you can always come back to this website, or [get in touch](mailto:{{ site.instructor_emails[0] }}?Subject={{ site.title}} Workshop) with us for further help!

Please do make sure that you [fill out the survey]({{ site.post_survey }}) before you end: the survey helps us and the central UKRN team understand how the training is being used and how it can be improved.
